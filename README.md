NOTES

- Building the socket.io client library can be a pain in the ass. The building method described here (https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-cpp/issues/258) should be followed quite closely. The above link mentioned Boost 1.67.0 and OpenSSL 1.0.2u; building was successful on OSX using Boost 1.73.0 and OpenSSL 3.0.0alpha-4.
